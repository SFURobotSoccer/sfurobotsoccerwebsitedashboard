              What Is Their Role

            <p className="plus-jakarta-sans-body text-sm w-11/12 leading-6">
              The Mechanics team gives shape and character to our team of robots
              and is a great way to get started in the club. Members are
              introduced to the basics of CAD and work on designing components
              such as base-plates, motor mounts and kicker systems, usually
              under the supervision of more senior members.<br></br>
              <br></br>
              During this process, the mechanics team focuses on creating an
              efficient design workflow and generating documentation so that
              future team members can learn about how our robots have evolved
              over time. Mechanics members primarily use SolidWorks to
              familiarize themselves with the basics of mechanical design and
              experience teamwork in a production environment.
